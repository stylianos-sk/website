# Website

Personal website of Stylianos Sarantellis Komninellis.

## Hosting & Deployment

The site is hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is available by default at https://stylianos-sk.github.io/website/ .

There is a [`hugo.yaml`](./.github/workflows/hugo.yaml) [GitHub actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflows) inspired by https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/hugo.yml located in the [`.github/workflows/`](./.github/workflows) directory in this repository which builds this hugo site on an Ubuntu machine and deploys it to GitHub pages.

The GitHub pages hosting and deployment settings are configured in https://github.com/stylianos-sk/website/settings/pages .

## TODOs

- [ ] Customise the site
- [ ] Add a favicon
